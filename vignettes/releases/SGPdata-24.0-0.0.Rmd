This is the 24.0 release of the **SGPdata** package. This release adds the **sgpData_LONG_COVID** data set which is used as a simulation data set to test out several situations
currently confronting states as they think about calculating student growth using spring 2021 data. This release bumps the year by 1 for the data with it now ending in 2020-2021 in 
the data sets.
